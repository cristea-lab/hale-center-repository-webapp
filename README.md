# Hale Center Repository

The Hale Center repository is a resource for data download and exploration of samples generated by Dr. Stephanie Dougan's Lab at the Hale center. The website is accessible at this URL ONLY within the DFCI network or while connected over VPN: http://haledatarepo.dfci.harvard.edu/. 

### Code Organization

The repository is written using Flask, which is a Python web framework. The format of the repository follows the "Flask Application Factory" pattern which is nicely explained here: https://hackersandslackers.com/flask-application-factory/.
